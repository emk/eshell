This is the NEWS file for Eshell, a command shell written in Emacs
Lisp.

Please note that proper documentation is still on its way.

* Changes in 2.4.2:

** This is just a bug fix release, following 2.4.1 after about six
   months.

* Changes in 2.4:

** Primarily a performance release, in addition to a few slight
   changes in avaliable configuration variables:

** There is a distinction made between "simple" and "complex"
   functions.  Complex functions are likely to cause modifications to
   the running Eshell command form, and thus require a form of
   evaluation that simulates Scheme continuations.  This uses three
   times as much memory as using plain `eval', which is entirely
   sufficient for "simple" commands such as ls, cp, mv, etc.

   NOTE: If you write a command named eshell/NAME, which must throw
   either `eshell-defer' or `eshell-replace-command', you must add
   NAME to `eshell-complex-commands'.

** `ls' now uses `eshell-ls-exclude-hidden' to indicate that files
   beginning with a dot should be excluded.

** `eshell-glob-show-progress' is now nil by default, since it slows
   down recursive glob processing so much.

** ange-ftp is no longer required to compile Eshell, which broke
   XEmacs users in 2.3.2.

** `eshell-ls-initial-args' is new, and should be used instead of
   command aliases to introduce a common argument (such as -h).

** Command aliases and smart scrolling are both very slow and memory
   consumptive, although not much can be done about this.  For
   complicated commands that themselves run slowly, the percentile
   impact is little.  But for quick, simple commands such as cd, ls,
   etc., command aliases should definitely be avoided.  And while
   smart scrolling (eshell-smart) is quite useful, it should be run on
   fast machines to be fully appreciated.

** The new option `eshell-stringify-t' determines whether Lisp `t'
   should be rendered as `t', or not at all.  The truth of an
   expression can still be determined using:

     file-exists-p FILE && echo true

** Added a new option `eshell-default-target-is-dot', which if non-nil
   states that the default target of cp/mv/ln is the current
   directory, which mirrors the behavior of most DOS shells.

* Changes in 2.3.2:

** More bug fixes.  Greatly improved remote directory support, since
   now nearly all file attributes can be viewed.

* Changes in 2.3.1:

** This a bug fix release, in preparation for inclusion as part of
   Emacs 21.

** One little feature, however, did sneak in: C-c C-y in the Eshell
   buffer will repeat the last argument entered.  With a numeric
   prefix, it will repeat that many arguments.

* Changes in 2.3:

** The control flow commands: if, unless, while, until: now test the
   exit code of external processes against 0 for truth, and the value
   of Lisp forms against t.  Before, they would only check to see if
   the test expression generated output.

** Because the Elisp manual declares that C-c LETTER bindings be left
   to the user, several of Eshell's command mode bindings had to be
   changed.  The equivalences are:

      2.2     2.3
     -----   -------
     C-c e   C-c M-v
     C-c p   C-c M-i
     C-c h   C-c M-o
     C-c b   C-c M-b
     C-c l   C-c M-l
     C-c ?   C-c M-q,
     C-c m   C-c M-m
     C-c i   C-c M-h
     
** Added support for a ksh feature: "cd OLD NEW".  This will replace
   OLD with NEW in the current directory name (the name returned by
   `pwd' specifically), and then attempt to change to that directory.

** Added a syntax convenience for short-circuited commands:

     file-exists-p file.cpp && echo file exists
     file-exists-p file.cpp || echo file does not exist

   These operators test either the return code of the Lisp function on
   the left-hand side (to determine if it's non-nil), or the exit code
   of an external function (testing for 0), whichever is appropriate.

   The precedence for these operators is lower than sequencing (;) and
   backgrounding (&), but higher than redirection (>) and piping (|).
   Within themselves, they are strictly left to right.  In this sense,
   it acts on a chain of success and failure, continuing to the next
   part of the chain only if the operator would allow it.

** Added three new configuration variables:

     eshell-mv-overwrite-files
     eshell-cp-overwrite-files
     eshell-ln-overwrite-files

   The default for all three is t.  If nil, a --force argument (-f) is
   required before any of the three commands will overwrite anything.
   This is different from --interactive (-i), which queries before
   destruction.

* Changes in 2.2:

** Added a "FEATURES" file to the distribution, which gives a brief
   overview of the features offered by Eshell.

** When `eshell-command' is invoked, the minibuffer is put into
   eshell-mode, making all of your preferred Eshell keybindings
   available (such as completion).

   To bind M-! to use eshell-command, customize the variable
   `eshell-prefer-to-shell'.

** If both the `eshell-history' and `eshell-rebind' are in use, C-r
   and C-s now behave similarly to bash.  In 2.1, it was necessary to
   enter a full regexp in the minibuffer before searching would
   begin.  Now it's incremental, using isearch.

** All of the optional Eshell extension modules are now named
   "em-NAME.el".  Required modules are named "esh-NAME.el".  This
   prevents name collisions from occuring on filesystems with 8.3 name
   limits.

** New conditional constructs: if, unless, while and until.  They can
   be used in any of the following fashions:

     if (string-match "gumby" (system-name)) {
  	echo true
     } else {
  	echo false
     }

     while {/sbin/ifconfig | egrep ppp0} {
        echo connected via ppp
     }

** New ls option implemented: -I GLOB.  Used to exclude files matching
   GLOB from the listing.

** New list argument modifiers: (:i/REGEXP/) strips all elements not
   matching REGEXP.  (:x/REGEXP/) strips all elements that do match
   the REGEXP.  Other delimiters can also be used: (:i,REGEXP,).

** Extended the file-time predicate, so that a file can be used as a
   comparison basis.  Example: "ls *(a+'file.c')" displays files
   accessed before "file.c" was last accessed.

** The eshell-xtra extension module now offers some cl (Emacs Common
   Lisp) convenience functions.  They make it much easier to perform
   complex manipulations on list arguments.  Since glob patterns and
   command substitutions both yield list values, they can be very
   useful.  To enable eshell-xtra, customize the variable
   `eshell-options-list'.

     # Return results of glob, minus happy.el.  The same as:
     #   *.el~happy.el

     remove happy.el *.el

     # Remove all duplicate lines from command results.  The same as:
     #   egrep johnw /etc/passwd | uniq

     remove-duplicates ${egrep johnw /etc/passwd}

     # Replace a given list element with another.  The same as:
     #   *.el(:s/em-ls\.el/happy.el/)

     substitute happy.el em-ls.el *.el

     # Return element value if member of a list.  This is roughly
     # equivalent to:
     #   echo *.el | egrep "^happy.el$" | uniq

     find happy.el *.el

     # Count the number of times a string appears in a list.
     # Equivalent to:
     #   echo *.el | egrep "^happy.el$" | wc -l

     count happy.el *.el

     # Combine two lists, eliminating duplicates.  Roughly equivalent
     # to (difference is that the result is always sorted):
     #   echo *.el e* | sort | uniq

     union *.el e*

     # Return overlapping members of two lists.  Roughly equivalent
     # to:
     #   comm -12 $<printnl *.el(:o:u)> $<printnl e*(:o:u)>

     intersection *.el e*

     # Return members unique to the first list.  Roughly equivalent
     # to:
     #   comm -23 $<printnl *.el(:o:u)> $<printnl e*(:o:u)>

     set-difference *.el e*

     # Return all members that don't overlap.  Roughly equivalent to:
     #  append ${comm -23 $<printnl *.el(:o:u)> $<printnl e*(:o:u)>}
     #         ${comm -13 $<printnl *.el(:o:u)> $<printnl e*(:o:u)>}
     
     set-exclusive-or *.el e*

** cp and mv now support moving and copying of directories.  With mv,
   this happens whenever a directory name is given as a source.  With
   cp, it requires using either the -R or -a switch.

   Please be careful when using these options.  A good backup policy
   is always worth the trouble, and until Eshell has been in active
   use for a few years, I wouldn't want to start moving directories
   around without a backup.

** Copying and moving directly TO a tar archive is allowed.  It
   creates the archive if it doesn't exist, and updates it if it does
   (removing the filesystem entries in the case of mv).  Note that
   this happens only with multiple sources, or a single directory
   source.

   If the archive name ends in ".tgz", ".tz2", ".taz", ".taZ",
   ".tar.gz", ".tar.bz2", or ".tar.Z", it will be
   compressed/decompressed appropriately.  Using "-v" after the
   command name also works, for displaying the filenames as they are
   copied/moved:

     cp -v some_dir some_dir.tar.bz2

** Implemented `du' in Lisp.  If an external version of `du' is
   present, it is always used instead, since the Lisp version is much
   slower, and blocks Emacs while it's running.

** Implemented `time' in Lisp.  It only displays elapsed wall-clock
   time, since Emacs doesn't provide facilities for determining the
   user/kernel time consumed by a subprocess.  Its usefulness lies in
   the fact that it can show the elapsed time of Lisp function calls,
   and it's available on all operating systems.

** If a `grep' command is neither redirected, nor part of a command
   pipeline, it's output will occur in a `*grep*' buffer, allowing the
   user to use C-x ` to move to the source of each hit.  The applies
   to the whole grep family: egrep, fgrep, agrep, and glimpse.

   Disable by customizing `eshell-plain-grep-behavior'.

** If a `diff' command is neither redirected, nor part of a command
   pipeline -- and if diff-mode.el is loaded -- the command's output
   will occur in a separate buffer in diff-mode, allowing the user to
   use C-x ` to move to each source difference.

   Disable by customizing `eshell-plain-diff-behavior'.

** If a `locate' command is neither redirected, nor part of a command
   pipeline -- and if diff-mode.el is loaded -- the command's output
   will occur in a separate buffer in locate-mode.

   Disable by customizing `eshell-plain-locate-behavior'.

** If a `make' command is sent to the background and not redirected,
   it's output will appear in a `*compilation*', allowing the user to
   enter C-x ` to view the source of each error.

** New list argument modifier ':u'.  This removes any contiguous
   duplicate strings in the list.  Used after ':o', it's the same as
   "sort | uniq".  Example:

     echo **/*.c(:o:u)   # returns uniq'd list of all .c files

** Arguments to `which' that are preceded by an asterix `*', will
   bypass alias lookup.  This makes it possible to find out what the
   alias will invoke.

** Three new globbing constructs: #?, #* and #+, which correspond to
   the ?, * and + regular expressions.  To show the correlation:

     glob   regexp
     ----   ------
      *       .*
      ?       .
      #*      *
      #+      +
      #?      ?
      ##      +      # zsh compatible
      #       *      # zsh compatible

** Changed the syntax of variable name quoting.  The new syntax is:

     $VAR-NAME       # interpolate the value of `VAR-NAME'
     $'VAR'-NAME     # interpolate `VAR', followed by "-NAME"
     $"VAR"-NAME     # (same)
     $"VA$VAR"-NAME  # interpolate `VAR' into "VA?", then interpolate
  		       into "?-NAME".  This syntax can be nested.

   Previously the argument "$<LOGNAME>-name" would have interpolated
   the value of $LOGNAME into the argument, yielding something like
   "johnw-name".

** New syntax for temporary data interpolation.  Example:

     xdu -n $<du -k>

   This invokes the command "du -k", copies the result to a temp file,
   then passes the name of that temp file as an argument to `xdu'.
   Once `xdu' completes, the temp file is deleted.

   This syntax is quite similar to "<{command}" in bash, except that
   Emacs doesn't permit writing to named pipes.

   This is also useful with commands that need multiple generated
   inputs:

     comm -23 $<cd ~/src; printnl **/*.c(:o:u)>   \
              $<cd /usr/src; printl **/*.c(:o:u)>

   This command will display all the .c files in "~/src" that are not
   in "/usr/src", with `comm' the only external process invoked.

** New commands: C-c ? and C-c m.  These two popup quick help buffers
   showing the various glob predicate and argument modifier
   characters.  All those characters were too easy to forget.

** Using the '@' predicate with globs containing directories now
   works.  Example: "ls -d *(^@)" (anywhere containing directories).

** Corrected the behavior of "ls -L".

** rm, cp, mv and ln now support "-i" (--interactive), which queries
   before overwriting/deleting any files.  This is the default when
   the user id is 0.

** Line splitting in command result interpolation now works.  This
   makes the following possible:

     length {listify {egrep blah FILE}}

   This invokes "egrep blah FILE", interpolating the result as a Lisp
   list, with each element a line of the output.  The above command
   will report how many hits were found.  Note that the `listify' is
   required here, since if egrep finds only one match, it will return
   it as a string, not a list.

** New configuration variable `eshell-virtual-targets'.  Allows the
   user to specify new virtual targets, such as "/dev/kill" and
   "/dev/null".

** New virtual target "/dev/eshell".  Anything output to this
   pseudo-device will be displayed in the Eshell window as normal
   output from the command.  Useful on operating systems without
   "tee", since it lets you both view the command output, and redirect
   it somewhere else:

     ls > blah > /dev/eshell   ; output goes to both "blah" and display

** New configuration variable `eshell-kill-processes-on-exit'.  It can
   be set to one of: t, ask, every, nil.  These settings mean:

   t     - kill all processes spawned by an Eshell buffer when it is
           killed/exited.

   ask   - same operation as t, but ask the user before doing so.

   every - some operation as ask, but query for every single process.

   nil   - don't kill processes on exit.  They will be killed only if
           Emacs itself is killed, or if the user kills/exits them.
           This is the default, and matches the behavior of 2.1.
   
** New configuration hook `eshell-first-time-mode-hook', which is
   called at the same time as `eshell-mode-hook' (just before it), but
   only once per Emacs session.

** Added '#*' '.#*' files to the `eshell-ls-backup-regexp'.

** Added '.bz2' files to the `eshell-ls-archive-regexp'.

** The "echo" command now takes a "-n" flag, which causes it to
   generate a newline after the printed text.

** New module `esh-toggle', which provides the global commands
   `eshell-toggle' and `eshell-toggle-cd'.

To use these functions, simply type `M-x eshell-toggle'.  With a
prefix argument, it is the same as calling `eshell-toggle-cd', which
emits a "cd $default-directory" immediately after switching.

If `eshell-toggle' is called once, it will bring up Eshell in another
window.  If called twice in succession, it will take up the whole
frame.  After doing anything in the Eshell buffer, calling
`eshell-toggle' yet again will restore the window configuration that
was extent before the first call.

** Improved support for XEmacs 21.1 and 21.2.

* Changes in 2.1:

** Eshell has been split into several functional "modules".
   There are base modules, which define the core of Eshell, and
   extension modules, whose use is entirely optional.  See the
   variable `eshell-modules-list'.

** comint.el is no longer used.  The functionality that Eshell had been
   using is now divided between eshell-mode.el, eshell-hist.el,
   eshell-cmpl.el and eshell-io.el.  Most of that code is now
   radically altered from its original form.

** there is complete documentation available, using a prototype
   embedded documentation system called "texidoc".  texidoc.el is
   included with the distribution of Eshell, but is not yet ready for
   general consumption.

** pushd, popd and dirs are provided in the extension module
   `eshell-dirs'.

** `cd', as defined in the extension module `eshell-dirs', can accept
   parent directory references of the form "...", where each
   additional "." refers to the next highest directory.

** recursive globbing, similar to zsh, is provided in the extension
   module `eshell-glob'.  The syntax is "**/*.c", which means matches
   all of the C files in the current directory and below.  Symbolic
   links are not traversed.  To traverse them, use three asterices:
   "***/*.c".

** argument predicates and modifiers are provided in the extension
   module `eshell-pred'.  The syntax is to suffix the argument with
   "(PREDS)" or "(:MOD:MOD)", or any combination.  The allowable
   predicates follow zsh syntax, whereas the allowable modifiers
   follow bash's history argument modifier syntax.  Thus, the command
   "echo alpha(:s/al/be/)" would yield the string "bepha".

   The history code and globbing rely upon this extension module to
   provide globbing predicates and history argument modifiers.  If it
   is not used, those facilities won't be available.  See the Info
   manual for a fuller description of predicates and modifiers, and
   how to use them.  They are comprehensive enough to replace the use
   of "find ... | xargs <cmd>" in most cases.

** the version info banner displayed at login is part of a
   sample extension module named `eshell-banner'.  It can be
   de-selected by disabling the use of that module.  If authors choose
   to write their on Eshell extension modules, they should copy this
   file ("eshell-banner.el") as a starting point.

** command aliases are provided in the extension module
   `eshell-alias'.  These aliases are intended for simplicity, and
   persist immediately (i.e., no customization of Lisp variable is
   necesary in order to use them).  The only caveat, and difference
   from other shells, is that argument expansion must always be
   provided by specifying '$*' somewhere in the alias string.  A
   typical use might be: "alias ll 'ls -l $*'"

** argument parsing has complete changed in structure.  It is now much
   easier for extension modules to extend the capability of the parser
   for their own needs.  See `eshell-dirs' for an example, which
   extends the parser to properly handle filenames beginning with a
   tilde character, such as "cat ~johnw/.emacs".

** several more UNIX commands are now implemented in Lisp, in the
   extension module `eshell-unix': basename, cat, cp, date, dirname,
   ln, man, mkdir, mv and rmdir.

** the extension module `eshell-basic' defines some of the more basic
   shell commands, which are typically builtins in most shells: echo,
   umask, version, etc.

** programmable, context-aware completion is available using the
   extension module `eshell-cmpl'.  This is accomplished by taking
   advantage of the functionality in the `pcomplete' module, which is
   included with the standard Eshell distribution.

** history code, which is almost entirely bash compatible, is provided
   in the extension module `eshell-hist'.

** rebinding of command keys while editing command input is provided
   in the extension module `eshell-rebind'.  For example, this causes
   C-u to delete the current input text, rather than act as the
   universal argument prefix -- but only while editing command input.
   This is done to make Eshell feel more like a standard system
   shell.  Once the point moves away from the command input text (C-c
   C-p is the typical way to do this), C-u takes on its normal
   meaning.

   The keys which get rebound, and their definition, are fully
   customizable.

** execution of Eshell scripts is provided in the extension module
   `eshell-script'.  The interpretor should be named
   "/usr/local/bin/eshell", which is not offered with this
   release. Eshell itself can execute such scripts, however, since it
   evaluates them within the currently running Emacs.

** a new form of smart output display is provided in the extension
   module `eshell-smart'.  See the Info manual for more details, since
   an accurate description of what "smart" means in this case is
   somewhat difficult to describe.

** a test suite is now included with Eshell, which is runnable by
   typing `M-x eshell-test'.  However, this test can only be run
   against non-byte-compiled sources.  For efficiency sake, all of the
   testing code is removed during byte-compilation.

** a few other niceties, such as implementing `expr' in terms of the
   calc package, or defining `make' to use compilation-mode whenever
   the user invokes it asynchronously, are provided in the extension
   module `eshell-xtra'.

** cd now maintains its own "directory ring", which remembers the last
   `eshell-last-dir-ring-size' places that Eshell has been to.  The
   syntax is:

     cd -       ; go to last location (swap top of ring and current)
     cd -4      ; go to 4th from last location
     cd =bcc    ; go to last location containing regexp "bcc"
     cd =       ; show list of locations
    
   If `eshell-last-dir-unique' is non-nil, this ring will never contain
   duplicate items.

** if an alias command like "ls" doesn't recognize a specified option,
   it will defer to the external version (searched for on the PATH).

** improved the "history" alias to be more like bash; specifically,
   there is support for the -r, -w and -a options.
 
** removed all dependencies on font-lock.  eshell now does its own
   buffer highlighting.

** added full support for colorized ls output.  To disable this
   feature, set `eshell-ls-use-colors' to nil.

** fixed a bug which was causing filter overruns when using pipes
   and processes that generate a lot of output (like "find" with
   "xargs").

** removed `eshell-ls-default-args'.  The proper way to pass default
   arguments to ls is by using a command alias.

** fixed a bug which prevented Eshell's ls from displaying very large
   file sizes.

* Changes in 1.5:

** eshell now uses comint directly, rather than duplicating that
   code.

For this to work, you will need an updated copy of comint, which can
no longer be found.

** optimized handling of output from a subprocess.  In cases where
   both standard output and standard error are both headed for the
   "*eshell*" buffer (which is most of the time), the comint filter is
   used directly, bypassing eshell's redirection code.

** there is a new user variable, `eshell-visual-commands'.  If any
   command name matches a member of this list, it will be executed
   using "term", and started in a new buffer.  When that process exits
   -- and if you were viewing that buffer at the time -- it will
   return you to eshell.

** fixed "/dev/null".  It now dumps output once again (before, it
   would give an error about trying to change the value of the
   constant symbol "nil").

** fixed a problem with subcommands that was causing "echo
   ${whoami}" not to work.

** implemented a simple version of "history" that mimics the
   behavior of bash's same command.  None of the command switches are
   supported, however, nor can an alternate history file be specified.
   Yet.

** if `eshell-input-ring-file-name' is non-nil (and it now defaults
   to "~/.history"), eshell will write out the current command history
   whenever the eshell buffer is killed.

** the "exit" alias will bury the eshell buffer; but it does not
   kill it (for the time being, there are some problems with trying to
   do that, while at the same time keep everything sane).

** after a call to `eshell-print', the display is now refreshed --
   with consquent result that some of the lisp functions are now
   visibly slower, although you can at least now see that they're
   doing something.  Setting `eshell-refresh-interval' to a higher
   value will make the functions run faster, but it will also make
   them seem a little choppier (no frequent updates).  Setting this to
   a really high number will match the functionality of 1.4.

** if a "foreground" process is active, pressing RETURN will send
   the current string to that process; if there are multiple
   foreground processes active, the user will be prompted for which
   one.  Note that eshell echos locally, so the app you're using (such
   as telnet) may have to turn echoing off.

** executables are searched for along the PATH, not the `exec-path'.
   Also, specifying a relative executable name now works (before,
   saying "src/ls", even if it was there, would not work).

** added an alias for "export" which behaves just as in bourne
   shell.  That is, you can now add to the path by saying:

     export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin"

** fixed a bug which made it impossible to say "echo $exec-path",
   and was causing $_ to be inaccessible.

** "ls -l" (the alias version, written in Lisp) now shows symbolic
   link targets.  "ls -r" correctly reverses the file list.  "ls -t"
   sorts by mod time.  Ganging up options ("ls -ltr") now also works.

** before calling start-process, use `expand-file-name' on the
   program name, so that relative paths are seen as absolute

** looking up the command interpretor got broken again in 1.4

** fixed problem where you couldn't cd to a directory with a numeric
   name

** `eshell-kill-alias' was reversing its arguments, so that "kill -9
   PROC" wasn't working.

** fixed a problem in `eshell-argument-syntax-list', that was
   causing process references (e.g., #<process ispell>) to cause a
   syntax error.

** if output continues to generate from a subprocess, and you move
   point to another window or frame, eshell will now scroll to the end
   of the buffer.  In 1.4, it would freeze the point of display at the
   location you were last at when leaving the window.

** protected a reference to `transient-mark-mode' with a call to
   `boundp', in case it's not bound yet.

** "date" now calls (current-time-string).  If you want the other
   functions of the date command, call it with an explicit path, such
   as /bin/date.  In the future, I'll make "date" an alias, and just
   call the real "date" if the alias doesn't recognize any of the
   command line switches.

** beyond these features and bugs, there were several other, smaller
   bugs fixed.  Thanks to everyone who submitted feedback, and
   provided test cases.  Most everything else on my TODO list is
   either a major bug, requiring redesign, or a new feature.

* Changes in 1.4

** `eshell-funcalln' was incorrectly calling `eshell-apply' rather
   than `eshell-applyn'.

** Pipes and subcommands were totally broken by the rewrite of the
   output handling code.  And subcommands were even changing the main
   eshell buffer!  So that's all working again.

** Always go the end of the current line when RETURN is pressed.

** Fixed a serious problem with globbing patterns and disk commands.

** Process interaction, when there is only one non-background
   process active, now works as expected again.

* Changes in 1.3

** The variable `eshell-cd-shows-directory' now control whether
   "cd" will report the directory name it changes to.

** The "alias" command didn't even really work, but now it's
   fixed.

** Removed dependency on `dired-replace-in-string' and
   `dired-glob-regexp'.

** If a variable is not found, it's value evaluates to "".  If a
   command cannot be found, it prints "name not found", as rc does
   (rc: the Other Shell [read like 'the Other Woman'] :).

** "ls" has been implemented in Lisp.  Remove it from the list of
   aliases if you still want to use the disk-based version.  If there
   are flags which my implementation does not recognize, it will
   revert to the disk based version.

** "rm" has been implemented to call the Lisp function
   `delete-file'.  If the argument is a buffer or process, it will
    kill it.  If it is a symbol, it will delete it.

** If `cd' is given an ange-ftp file name, and then a disk
   command is run from that directory, eshell will call
   `shell-command' so that the command is run via "rsh" on the remote
   machine.

** Command aliases take a new second argument which allows you
   specify what kind of alias you're defining.  So it's now possible
   to define an alias as '("ll" command "ls -l").

** The history and input handling code was copied directly over from
   comint, rather than being reimplemented.  The only changes I had to
   make were due to the fact that comint assumes that the current
   buffer always has exactly one underlying process associated with
   it.  So although it's ugly to block move that much code, rather
   than just reuse it in place, at least for this version eshell
   supports comint's code for history and input navigation:

*** !! accesses last command

*** !command searches for last command, with option of command
    being a ;; regexp

*** !?<TAB> causes the current line to be replaced with that
    history ;; element

*** M-p M-n walk through the history list

*** If RETURN is pressed at a previous location in the eshell
    buffer (i.e., before `eshell-output-mark'), repeat the command
    text at the bottom before executing it.

*** Note: numerical references to history sub-elements are
    currently ignored.

* Changes in 1.2

** Fixed some bugs with list flattening, `eshell-echo' and
   `eshell-dos-to-unix'.

** Removed "grep" alias.  Too troublesome and confusing.

** Giving a prefix argument to C-RET (send string to process),
   will cause Emacs to read the input as a password.  Also, a newline
   is now automatically appended to the string sent.

** Fixed many bugs dealing with aliases and foreign command
   interpretors.  How did all those bugs creep in?  :)

** The "dos2unix" alias no longer untabifies your files.

** Added aliases for "setq" and "if".  More to come...

** Added some bindings to provide some compatibility with what
   comint users expect.

** Accessing history is now possible with "!command".  The last
   command is available using "!!".  If `eshell-history-by-regexp' is
   non-nil, you can use "!regexp", which will match anywhere with the
   line, requiring "!^regexp" to emulate the default behavior.

** "cd -" will return to the last directory visited.

** Variable referencing is now supported.  It takes many forms:

*** $VARIABLE      name of an environment or Lisp variable

*** $ALSO-VAR      "-" is considered part of a name

*** $<MYVAR>-TOO   only "MYVAR" is part of the variable name

*** $#VARIABLE     length of the value of VARIABLE

*** $(lisp)

Returns result of lisp evaluation.  Note: Used alone like this, it is
identical to just saying (lisp); but with the variable expansion form,
the result may be interpolated a larger string, like "$(lisp)/other".

*** ${command}

Returns the value of an eshell subcommand.  See the note above
regarding lisp evaluations.  The same applies here.

*** $ANYVAR[10]

Attempts to return the 10th element of ANYVAR.  If ANYVAR's value is a
string, it will be split in order to make it a list.  The splitting
will occur at whitespace.

*** $ANYVAR[: 10]

Just like above, except that splitting occurs at the colon now.

*** $ANYVAR[: 10 20 ]

Like above, but instead of returning just a string, it now returns a
list of two elements.  If the result is being interpolated into a
larger string, this list will be flattened into one big string, with
each element separated by a space.

*** $ANYVAR["\\\\" 10]

Separate on backslash characters.  Actually, the first argument -- if
it doesn't have the form of a number, or plain variable name -- is
just a regular expression.  So if you did want to split on numbers,
you could say:

  $ANYVAR["[0-9]+" 10 20].

*** $ANYVAR[hello]

Does an assoc with ANYVAR, expecting it to be an alist.

*** $#ANYVAR[hello]

Returns the length of the element of the alist ANYVAR who car is equal
to "hello"

*** Thus, you can now do crazy things like:

  1+ ${egrep johnw /etc/passwd}[: $pu-index] > 'uid-after-me

And return the value of the `pu-index'th element of your passwd entry
(let's assuming it's set to 2, the user id), increment it by one, and
then store this integer in the Lisp variable `uid-after-me'.

** $_ is defined (via an alias) as the arguments for the last
   command.  If referenced plainly, it refers to the last argument of
   the last argument.  If referenced as an array, it will return the
   Nth argument of the last command.

* Changes in 1.1

** Fixed a bug which made some of the defcustom forms unusable.

** `esh' is an alias for `eshell-subcommand', making it easier to
   run eshell commands synchronously from lisp forms.

** Fixed some erroneous ways that files were being separated and
   globbed.  Failed globs get passed as the glob string.

** Special characters in filenames are now quoted when doing name
   completion.

** Eshell outputs a short banner message on startup, announcing the
   version.  Set `eshell-display-banner-p' to nil to turn this off.

** Removed the troublesome global variables that were being used
   for capturing the output from the subcommands.

** Outputting to 'nil, or the pseudo-name "/dev/null", will drop
   output.

** Using ";;" means three empty commands now, instead of the
   unknown token ";;".

** The process interaction functions, such as C-c C-c, now always
   use the currently running sub-process if eshell has invoked only
   one.  Otherwise, it prompts from among all running processes in
   Emacs.

** Changed C-c RET to just C-RET.

** Emacs-lisp-mode is run before switching the major mode to
   eshell, so that any hooks (like starting eldoc mode) work as you
   would expect for a lisp mode.

* Changes in 1.0 (from the first pre-release version 0.2)

** Simplified the code a great deal, and broke it down into several
   more functions.

** Now uses `dired-glob-regexp', instead of duplicating that code.

** Redirection is possible to multiple targets.  They will all
   receive the same output.

** Redirection of files, buffers or processes, using the Emacs
   syntax #<buffer NAME> or #<process NAME>.  If
   `eshell-buffer-shorthand' is nil, you can even redirect into a lisp
   variable using the syntax: 'name.

** If you redirect within a pipe, the output will still go to the
   pipe, eliminating the need for "tee".  To prevent this behavior,
   set `eshell-always-to-pipe' to nil.

** When redirecting to a buffer, the operator ">>>" will cause the
   redirection to insert at the current location of point in that
   buffer.  Beware of the asynchronous nature of the subprocess,
   though, since it will continue inserting at point, even if point
   moves around.

** ~, ~user, and /:/path (to prevent environment variable
   substitution) are now supported.

** You can turn off the bogus nature of "&" by setting
   `eshell-support-ampersand' to nil.

** There is now extensive support for aliases, and redefinition of
   commands.

You can either replace the definition of a command, or alter it.  You
can also modify the output which comes from the command, and still
have it show up in all the places the user specified redirections to.

** Synchronous subcommands are supported, and can be used either to
   generate output, or to substitute for an argument.

The syntax used is similar to rc, except that no whitespace is allowed
after the initial brace.  This is so that users can avoid the tedium
of quoting all the time.

  echo {cd; ls}      ; echos contents of home directory
  echo {+ 1 3}       ; print `t', since sub-expr yields non-nil
  {+ 1 3}            ; evalute in a subcommand, and print result

** Synchronous chaining of commands is supported, using ";":

  ls; ls -l; ls; ls -l     ; appears in the order you expect

** There is a series of functions behind C-c now, for the purposes
   of interrupting processes.

** You can use C-c p and C-c b to insert named references to
   process and buffers.

** When a subprocess asks a question, you cannot answer it just by
   typing into the eshell buffer, since there's no way to know for
   certain which asynchronous subprocess you intend for the string to
   go to.  Instead, use C-c RET, select the name of the process, and
   then enter your string in the minibuffer.
